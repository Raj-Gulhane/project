            <div class="farming-content">
                <h2>Subsistence Farming</h2>
                <p>Subsistence farming is a type of agriculture where farmers grow food crops primarily to meet the needs of their family or local community. It involves small-scale farming using traditional tools and methods, with little to no surplus for trade. This farming method is common in developing countries and is often practiced in areas with low rainfall, poor soil, and limited access to technology. Subsistence farmers typically grow a variety of crops, such as grains, vegetables, and fruits, alongside raising livestock to support their households. The crops produced are primarily for consumption, with little surplus available for the market. In some cases, farmers may trade excess crops in local markets, but this is not the primary goal. Over time, subsistence farming has become more challenging due to environmental changes and the spread of modern farming techniques.</p>

            <div class="farming-content">
                <h2>Shifting Cultivation</h2>
                <p>Shifting cultivation is a traditional farming practice where farmers clear a plot of land, use it for a few years until its fertility declines, and then move on to a new area. This method is typically used in tropical regions with dense forests. The cleared land is usually burned in a process called "slash-and-burn," which provides nutrients to the soil. While it can be sustainable in low-population areas, shifting cultivation can lead to deforestation and soil erosion when used on a large scale. Farmers often rely on indigenous knowledge to determine when to move on to new plots. However, shifting cultivation is being challenged due to population pressure, leading to reduced land availability and increasing deforestation. In some cases, shifting cultivation is being replaced by more intensive farming methods, which can result in long-term environmental damage.</p>
