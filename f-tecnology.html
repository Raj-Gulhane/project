                Drones have revolutionized agriculture by providing high-resolution aerial images for crop monitoring.
                They allow farmers to detect issues such as pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies early, which
                leads to better yield and cost savings. Drones also facilitate precision agriculture by gathering
                real-time data, which can be used for targeted actions like spraying pesticides or watering specific
                areas. This results in resource conservation and reduces the need for manual labor. In addition, drones
                provide valuable insights for field mapping and crop yield predictions.

                Vertical farming is an innovative farming technique where crops are grown in stacked layers, often in
                controlled indoor environments. This method maximizes space usage, especially in urban areas, and allows
                for year-round crop production regardless of weather conditions. Vertical farming relies heavily on
                hydroponics and aeroponics, systems that use nutrient-rich water or air to grow plants without soil. It
                reduces water usage compared to traditional farming methods and eliminates the need for pesticides,
                making it an eco-friendly alternative to conventional farming.
